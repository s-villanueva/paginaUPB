            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Integral Logistics comprehensively addresses all processes that enable the management of the flow of
                goods, services, or information throughout the entire network of operations within an organization.
                Proper determination of these processes is key within any company, as they include various activities
                and decisions. It is vital to know and perform adequate planning, organization, direction, and control
                of the entire supply system to satisfy internal needs (from supplier management, supply scheduling,
                inventory control, and material distribution) as well as the physical distribution system focused on
                outbound logistics to satisfy final consumer needs. Current competition requires companies to have
                excellent fluidity and synchronization to be notable in the market, optimizing the cash-to-cash cycle
                while delivering the best service.

                GPU-accelerated computing revolutionizes logistics optimization by enabling real-time analysis of
                complex supply chain networks with thousands of nodes and millions of possible routes. Students can
                leverage GPU infrastructure to solve large-scale vehicle routing problems, optimize warehouse layouts
                using advanced simulation, and perform predictive analytics on massive logistics datasets. With campus
                GPU resources, learners can implement machine learning models for demand forecasting, analyze real-time
                IoT sensor data from transportation fleets, and optimize multi-echelon inventory systems that would be
                computationally prohibitive on traditional hardware. This computational power enables students to tackle
                logistics challenges at the scale faced by companies like Amazon, DHL, and Maersk, preparing them for
                careers in modern supply chain management where data-driven decision-making is essential.
