            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This course focuses on techniques and algorithms for extracting useful knowledge from databases.
                It begins with an introduction to the CRISP-DM methodology and handling different types of data,
                as well as key preprocessing processes such as cleaning, normalization, and dimensionality reduction.
                Students will study methods for extracting association rules, sequence mining, and graph mining,
                as well as supervised classification techniques and model evaluation using standard metrics.
                Unsupervised clustering techniques and their validation are also covered. Finally, time series
                analysis and predictive models are introduced. This course provides the foundation for transforming
                data into valuable knowledge, supporting decision-making in various fields.

                Integrating GPU-accelerated AI tools into this Data Mining course significantly enhances the learning
                experience
                by enabling students to process large-scale datasets efficiently, train complex machine learning models
                in real-time,
                and experiment with deep learning architectures for pattern recognition. GPU computing allows for rapid
                execution
                of computationally intensive algorithms such as PCA, SVM, Random Forest, and neural networks. Students
                can leverage
                campus GPU infrastructure to work with big data frameworks, perform parallel processing for clustering
                algorithms,
                and explore advanced techniques like graph neural networks and transformer models for sequence mining.
                AI-driven
                analytics tools can provide intelligent insights, automated feature engineering, and real-time
                visualization of
                mining results, preparing students for modern data science challenges in industry and research.
