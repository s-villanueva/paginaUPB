                This Selected Topics in AI course is uniquely positioned to leverage GPU-accelerated computing for
                cutting-edge AI research and development. Students will utilize campus GPU infrastructure to train
                complex deep learning models in minutes rather than hours, experiment with large language models like
                GPT and BERT, and process high-resolution images for computer vision tasks in real-time. GPU computing
                enables parallel processing of massive datasets, allowing students to work with state-of-the-art
                architectures including transformers, diffusion models, and multi-modal AI systems. The course
                emphasizes
                practical implementation using frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow with CUDA acceleration, preparing
                students for careers in AI research, machine learning engineering, and data science where GPU computing
                is essential for developing next-generation AI applications in autonomous systems, medical imaging,
                financial modeling, and natural language understanding.
